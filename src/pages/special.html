            <h3>AutoPen</h3>
            <p>It is perhaps the most obvious, since it's the primary service that we offer.  There are a few other companies
                who do what we do, but none of them do it better.  Signing machines have been on the market for a long time, but
                David Redmon was the first in the industry to offer his customers the option to use a machine to write variable
                data with a pen.  Other competitors were quick to design their own machines, but they have yet to match our quality,
                strategy, or capacity.

            <h3>Quality</h3>
            <p>It is the point of pride for Pioneer.  Conventional mail shops put out prodcuts that are "good enough", but we
                always strive for perfection.  Other shops might throw out pieces that jam in their equipment, but we are willing
                to go the extra mile to complete or rework.  You never know when that one piece that jammed was a $10,000 donor.

            <h3>Strategy</h3>
            <p>This is an area where we excel.  David has spent many years working with clients and testing different strategies to
                see what works.  You might see some strange things that are time-tested strategies for boosting response.  Multiple
                stamps on the reply envelope, a folded reply envelope, and no-frills note cards work well with nonprofit donors.
                Post-it notes, color envelopes and bright, shiny cards are favorites with commercial clients.

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>This is why our clients stick around.  An AP package that implements our strategies can easily triple the return on
                investment that clients see from their conventional mail pieces.

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Last, but certainly not least, this is our reason for being.  We are a community, and together we are driven by a desire
                to serve not only our clients, but one another.  When an issue comes up, we don't point fingers and lay blame -- we work 
                together to create and implement lasting solutions, and we grow and learn from those experiences.
